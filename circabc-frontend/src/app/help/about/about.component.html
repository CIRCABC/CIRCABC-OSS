  <h2>Can you speak CIRCABC?</h2>

  <p>
    The application is divided into Categories and Interest Groups, allowing
    people in those groups to share information and resources.
  </p>
  <p>
    CIRCABC calls an INTEREST GROUP (IG) the private workspace shared by a
    community of users and a CATEGORY is a set of Interest Groups. Some Interest
    Groups may be entirely or partly public (no authentication required). Others
    can be entered by any logged-in user ("registered access"). Others are
    reserved for their members.
  </p>

  <p>
    An Interest Group is characterized by a group of users (potentially
    unlimited), a set of services (Information, Library, Members, Events,
    Forums, etc.) and a series of contents.
  </p>

  <p>
    Users may be granted more or less rights depending on their access profile.
